    <h2>Combinators</h2>
    <p>A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.</p>
    <div>
        There are four different combinators in CSS:
        <ul>
            <li>descendant selector (space)</li>
            <li>child selector (>)</li>
            <li>adjacent sibling selector (+)</li>
            <li>general sibling selector (~)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Descendant Selector-The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.
    </h2>
    <h2>Child Selector (>)-The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.</h2>
    <h2>Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)-The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after
        another specific element.Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately
        following".</h2>
    <h2>General Sibling Selector (~)-The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a
        specified element.</h2>
</body>
