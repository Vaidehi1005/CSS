    <h3>Types of selectors</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Simple(select elements based on name, id, class)</li>
        <li>Combinators(select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</li>
        <li>Pseudo-class(select elements based on a certain state)</li>
        <li>Pseudo-element(select and style a part of an element)</li>
        <li>Attribute(select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</li>

    <h2>Combinators</h2>
    <p>A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.</p>
    <div>
        There are four different combinators in CSS:
        <ul>
            <li>descendant selector (space)</li>
            <li>child selector (>)</li>
            <li>adjacent sibling selector (+)</li>
            <li>general sibling selector (~)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Descendant Selector-The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.
    </h2>
    <h2>Child Selector (>)-The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.</h2>
    <h2>Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)-The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after
        another specific element.Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately
        following".</h2>
    <h2>General Sibling Selector (~)-The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a
        specified element.</h2>
    <h2>Pseudo classes-A pseudo class is used to define a special state of an element.</h2>
    <p>Syntax
        selector:pseudo-class {
        property: value;
        }
    </p>
    <p>Anchor Pseudo-classes
        a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in order to be effective! a:active MUST come
        after a:hover in the CSS definition in order to be effective! Pseudo-class names are not case-sensitive.
    </p>
    <P>Pseudo-classes and HTML Classes-Pseudo-classes can be combined with HTML classes</P>
    <P>Hover on div-An example of using the :hover pseudo-class on a
        div element</P>
    <h2>What are Pseudo-Elements-A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
        A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
        Insert content before, or after, the content of an element
    </h2>
    <p>Syntax
        selector::pseudo-element {
        property: value;
        }
    </p>
